        The Silk community is in its infancy and as such is pretty flexible right now.  We work around one principle belief... <span class="label label-info">quod severis metes</span> which translates as 'as you sow, so shall you reap'.  We are all in this to make something useful, and we hope to have fun along the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        For formatting we prefer two space indentation, this seems to work well for HTML and cross editor/IDE compatibility.  For patch/commits/pull requests we prefer small atomic units of work where the intent is clearly expressed and one topic is submitted at a time.  As we are on Github feature branches are best for pull requests.
      </p>
      <p>
        To get started with contributing just come and ask about it on the mailing list.  We have plenty of ideas for things that need to be done.  Several are listed below.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>new site prototype's</li>
        <li>new components static and dynamic</li>
        <li>general improvements to the somewhat prototypy code</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Our <a href="https://github.com/organizations/silk-web-toolkit/dashboard/issues">issues list</a> is usually kept up to date over on Github.
