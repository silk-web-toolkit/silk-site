          Rich websites, webapps and webservices built with re-usable components using nothing but vanilla HTML and CSS by default.  A well designed web publishing toolkit, with powerful technologies under the hood rolled into an incredibly intuitive, simple interface.  Eradicate the battle with server side languages by just neatly side-stepping them.  End semantic pollution... Silk is POSH (Plain Old Semantic HTML).

          Look at the change in just 10 years from a server side perspective versus the change in HTML over 20 years.  Which would you choose to invest in ?  Is there a bigger user community than the HTML user community ?  It's time to let these users build with HTML !

          Silk will evolve so it can be used in two ways, the first is to build simple static websites, the second to build dynamic webapps and webservices.  The static website version is in its infancy, but useful enough to build with already.  We eat our own dogfood, below is a list of sites we have built with Silk.

        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://www.bheap.co.uk">bheap.co.uk</a></li>
          <li><a href="index.html">this site</a></li>
        </ul>
