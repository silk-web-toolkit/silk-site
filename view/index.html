          Rich websites, webapps and webservices built with re-usable components using nothing but vanilla HTML5 and CSS by default.  A well designed web publishing toolkit, with powerful technologies under the hood rolled into an incredibly intuitive, simple interface.  Eradicate the battle with server side languages by just neatly side-stepping them.  End semantic pollution... Silk is POSH (Plain Old Semantic HTML5).
        </p>
        <p>
          Look at the change in just 10 years from a server side perspective versus the change in HTML over 20 years.  Which would you choose to invest in ?  Is there a bigger user community than the HTML user community ?  It's time to let these users build with HTML !
        </p>
        <p>
          How many of your websites really need to be dynamic beyond a contact form ?  Every time you use a dynamic web framework you open attack vectors on what you are delivering to your clients.  Silk works at compile time, there are fewer security issues.

          Lower the barrier to entry for developers and designers on your team, anyone can work with HTML5 and CSS.

          Silk will evolve so it can be used in two ways, the first is to build simple static websites, the second to build dynamic webapps and webservices.  The static website version is already useful enough to build with.  We eat our own dogfood, below is a list of sites we have built with Silk.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://www.bheap.co.uk">bheap.co.uk</a></li>
          <li><a href="index.html">this site</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Silk is also in use on two commercial projects for large technology companies.  More details forthcoming soon hopefully.
